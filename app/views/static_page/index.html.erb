                Great question! DotA 2 has a form of skill rating for each player called MMR, which goes from 0 to infinity,
                although the highest anyone has ever gotten is a little over 9000. The "Trench" is anywhere under 3000 MMR,
                and it's called that because once players fall in, it's a very long and treacherous climb to get out, filled
                with feeders, flamers, and some of DotA 2's worst players. The Trench League is a tournament meant only
                for those players.

                Registration is super easy. All you have to do is sign in with your Steam account and then connect your
                Discord account. After that, you can access our growing Discord community, and use our super awesome
                online portal to create and manage your team, as well as schedule matches and scrims with other Trench
                League teams. When your team is ready to compete, there is a small $5 registration fee which is handled
                by our secure payment provider, Stripe.
